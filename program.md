## Detailed schedule

The detailed schedule will be announced closer to the event. We will open with a
meeting on Monday at 10am to coordinate plans for the week, and follow a pattern
of "Standups" each day at around 9am in the morning, and 4pm in the afternoon to
communicate what we have worked on.

We expect to close the meeting by 3pm on Friday.

## Topics and projects

The overarching theme of this GAP Days will be GAP's infrastructure for
computing with permutation groups, such as orbit and stabiliser algorithms, base
and strong generating sets, partition backtrack for stabiliser, normaliser, and
canonical images, chief series, Sylow subgroups, Schur multipliers and
cohomology, and recognition methods for permutation groups.

A more detailed program will be announced closer to the event. If you have any
queries or suggestions, then please do not hesitate to contact the organisers.

1. __Overview of existing Permutation Group Code in GAP__

2. __Partition backtrack methods in the GAP library__

3. __Recognition methods for large base groups__
