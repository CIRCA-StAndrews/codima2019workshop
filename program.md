<h2>Abstracts</h2>

**Corneliu Hoffman** (Birmingham): *Spatchcoq-taming poultry, an approach to teaching proofs with computers* (30 minutes)

I will present a software approach to teaching students how to write proofs. This is based on a bespoke customisable 
interface to Coq. For details ask me or see http://spatchcoq.co.uk/spatchcoq. While it is not exactly 
discrete mathematics, most teaching examples are.

**Sergey Kitaev** (Strathclyde): *Computational challenges in the theory of word-representable graphs* (1 hour)

Encording graphs by words can be useful in solving problems on graphs. The much studied word-representable graphs
can be encoded using alternation of letters in words. These graphs generalise several important classes of graphs
such as 3-colorable graphs, combarability graphs, and circle graphs. Recognising word-representability is an
NP-complete problem. One of the current computational challenges is enlaging the set of graphs whose 
non-word-representability can be verified by a human. Another computational direction is describing new 
subclasses of (non-)word-representable split graphs. Finally, yet another interesting direction from 
computational point of view is studying 12-representable graphs, a subclass of comparability graphs that 
includes permutation graphs and co-interval graphs.

**Vince Knight** (Cardiff): *An open reproducible game theoretic framework* (30 minutes)

In the 1980s Robert Axelrod carried out computer experiments that continue to be cited today
as an explanation for the emergence of cooperative behaviour. I will discuss an open source
piece of software that not only reproduced this but importantly (continues) to extend it. 

**Alexander Konovalov** (St Andrews): *CoDiMa CCP: 5 years on* (1 hour)

An overview of community building and software maintenance activities being undertaken under CoDiMa CCP.

**Steve Linton** (St Andrews): *meataxe64: a quick advert* (15 minutes)

An overview of [meataxe64](https://meataxe64.wordpress.com/) and a
[GAP package](https://github.com/gap-packages/meataxe64) which provides
low-level GAP bindings to use it from GAP.

**Patrick Maier** (Sheffield Hallam): *Scaling parallel combinatorial search* (30 minutes)

I will talk about [YewPar](https://github.com/BlairArchibald/YewPar) a new C++ framework 
for parallel combinatorial search. The framework is suitable for scaling backtracking 
search/optimisation to large distributed compute clusters.

**Dima Pasechnik** (Oxford): *On decomposing representations in charateristic 0* (30 minutes)

We discuss our exerience with implementing a classical decomposition method for representations of 
finite groups over **C**. We (re)discovered few interesting tricks to speed up seemingly very hard parts. 
Joint work with my student Kaashif Hymabaccus, who also implemented all this as 
GAP package https://gitlab.com/kaashif/decomp.

**Sergey Shpectorov** (Birmingham): *Computing axial algebras* (30 minutes)

Axial algebras are commutative non-associative algebras inherently related to groups. 
Examples include the Griess algebra for the Monster simple group and the classical Jordan 
algebras. 

In 2013 I proposed an algorithm for computing axial algebras based on the concept 
of a partial algebra and an expansion. The initial version of the program was in GAP. 
However, later a more powerful MAGMA version was created by McInroy. This is mainly 
due to better linear algebra/group modules implementation in MAGMA. In the talk 
I'll discuss the structure of the algorithm and the necessary operations, as well 
as a few ideas how the efficiency of the implementation can be improved.

**Leonard Soicher** (QMUK): *Classifying the nonsynchronizing primitive permutation groups* (30 minutes)

The groups of the title are of interest to researchers in permutation groups, semigroups, and automata 
theory, and the current classification (up to degree 314) has required the development and use of new 
functionality in the GRAPE package for finding maximum cliques and proper vertex k-colourings, 
exploiting graph symmetry.

**Chris Wensley** (Bangor): *Recent developments in packages XMod and Groupoids* (30 minutes)

The talk will include: enumeration of cat2-group structures on a group; conversion between crossed squares 
and cat2-groups; crossed modules over groupoids; more general digraphs.
