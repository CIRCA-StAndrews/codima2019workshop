## GAP in general

[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to influence the future
development of GAP. To streamline each meeting the organizers usually suggest a few
main topics to work on during the week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in core GAP
and packages via short talks. However, the focus of the meeting is on code
development, with talks only playing a minor role.
As enough GAP experts will be around for technical support, the
meetings offer good opportunities for people to work on their own
packages. At the end of the week, we would be happy to hear about any progress you made.

## {{ site.title }}

GAP Days Spring 2019 will have the theme "Modern Permutation Group Algorithms". As
with previous GAP Days we will aim to survey and develop the algorithmic infrastructure
for permutation groups in GAP, starting from the basic orbit/stabiliser algorithms.

We would also like this GAP Days to be an opportunity for interested
(PhD-)students, post-docs, and more experienced mathematicians with little
knowledge of the insides of GAP to join in, meet us and each other, and learn
about algorithmic group theory in a relaxed atmosphere.

More detailed information can be found on [the program page]({{ site.baseurl }}/program).
