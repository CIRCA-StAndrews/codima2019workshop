## GAP in general

[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to discuss, influence, and
contribute to the future development of GAP. To streamline each meeting, the
organisers usually suggest a few main topics to work on during the week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in GAP
itself, and its packages, via short talks.  However, the focus of the meetings
is on development, with talks playing only a minor role.  As enough GAP experts
will be around for advice and technical support, the meetings offer particularly
good opportunities for people to work on their own packages. At the end of the
week, we would be happy to hear about any progress you made.

The theme of this GAP Days will be “Modern Permutation Group Algorithms”. During
this GAP Days, we aim to survey and develop the algorithmic infrastructure for
permutation groups in GAP, beginning with the basic orbit/stabiliser algorithms.

We would also like this GAP Days to be an opportunity for all interested people
with little knowledge of the insides of GAP to join in: this includes students,
PhD students, post-docs, and more experienced mathematicians. You will be able
to meet us and each other, and learn about GAP development and algorithmic group
theory in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
