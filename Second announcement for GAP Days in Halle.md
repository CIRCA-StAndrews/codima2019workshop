Second announcement of GAP Days in Halle
===

Dear all,

We warmly invite you to the beautiful Halle an der Saale in Germany for the 9th GAP Days, which will take place from 18th-22nd March 2019. Registration is open at:

  https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2019-spring/registration
  
We have set aside a small number of hotel rooms for participants of the GAP Days, **available until 2nd February**, at the TRYP by Wyndham Halle. Instructions on how to make use of this offer are available on the registration page.

The theme of this GAP Days will be “Modern Permutation Group Algorithms”. During this GAP Days, we aim to survey, understand, and develop the algorithmic infrastructure for permutation groups in GAP. To support these aims, we will begin by spending the first day reviewing and discussing the current functionality in GAP for permutations and permutation groups, beginning with the way permutations are stored and the basic orbit-stabiliser algorithms, and identifying areas in the code and documentation for improvement as we proceed.

We will also include a small number of additional talks during the GAP Days about computing with permutation groups in GAP. If there is a particular topic in this area that you would like to hear a talk about, then please include details in the comment box at registration.

We would like this GAP Days to be an opportunity for all interested people with little knowledge of the insides of GAP to join in: this includes undergraduate students, PhD students, post-docs, and more experienced mathematicians. You will be able to meet us and each other, and learn about GAP development and algorithmic group theory in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.

If you have any questions, or doubts about whether this event is for you, then please feel free to contact us by email at gapdays2019-spring@gapdays.de

We hope to see you in Halle!
Chris, Markus, Rebecca, and Wilf
