Announcement for GAP Days in Halle
===

Dear all,

We warmly invite you to beautiful Halle an der Saale in Germany for the 9<sup>th</sup> GAP Days, which will take place from 18<sup>th</sup>-22<sup>nd</sup> March 2019. Registration is now open at:

  https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2019-spring/registration

The theme of this GAP Days will be “Modern Permutation Group Algorithms”. During this GAP Days, we aim to survey and develop the algorithmic infrastructure for permutation groups in GAP, beginning with the basic orbit/stabiliser algorithms.

We would also like this GAP Days to be an opportunity for all interested people with little knowledge of the insides of GAP to join in: this includes undergraduate students, PhD students, post-docs, and more experienced mathematicians. You will be able to meet us and each other, and learn about GAP development and algorithmic group theory in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.

To support these aims, we would like to include a small number of talks about computing with permutation groups in GAP. If there is a particular topic in this area that you would like to hear a talk about, then please include details in the comment box at registration.  If you would be interested in contributing such a talk, then please include your proposed title.

We have set aside a small number of hotel rooms at the TRYP by Wyndham Halle for participants of the GAP Days; instructions on how to make use of this offer are available on the registration page.

Hope to see you in Halle!
